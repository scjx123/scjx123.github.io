summary: A simulation project for indoor SLAM to obtain ground truth. 
---

This is a summer project i've conducted with NUS Advance Robotic Center over the summer of 2020. The objective is to build an indoor office environment 
for the virtual Husky robot to conduct various SLAM algorithm for the team to compare and obtain ground truth for the larger project that involves Laikago from unitTree. 

I have modified the Husky URDF to equip it with Intel D435 Realsense Camera and Velodyne-32 for it to conduct SLAM. We've also used pointcloud to laserscan plugins in order 
to generate the Rviz scans successfully.
